# 370J Media Commons Room Reservation App

## About

This application is designed for reserving rooms at the 370J Media Commons Room.

## Technologies Used

- **Google App Script**: For backend scripting and integration.
- **React & Google App Script**: Utilizing [React-Google-Apps-Script](https://github.com/enuchi/React-Google-Apps-Script) for a responsive front-end experience.
- **clasp**: For Google Apps Script project management and deployment.

## Deployment

We employ GitHub workflows for our deployment process. Pushing or merging to different branches will automatically trigger different Google App Script deploys:
- `main` branch: triggers the DEVELOPMENT deploy, which serves from localhost and reads/writes the development calendars
- `staging` branch: triggers the STAGING deploy, which serves from the GAS project and reads/writes the development calendars
- `prod` branch: triggers the PRODUCTION deploy, which serves from the GAS project and reads/writes the **production** calendars

The `NODE_ENV` environment variable controls where we serve from, and the `CALENDAR_ENV` environment variable controls which calendars we use. These values are specified in the `package.json` commands triggered by the workflows

## Preparation

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- `.clasprc.json` file from another developer.
- `deploymentId` for Google Apps Script.

## Setup Instructions

When developing locally, please follow the flow below.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
2. **Configure `.clasprc.json`**:
   Set up the `.clasprc.json` file with the necessary credentials.
3. **Install Packages**:

   npm install
   ```
   
4. **Upload Local Code to Google App Script**:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   Please continue running this and execute the following command.

5. **Create a New Version of Google App Script**:
   Deploy using clasp, targeting your `deploymentId`:
   ```bash
   clasp deploy --deploymentId ${deploymentID} -d DEV_YOURNAME
   ```
6. **Access the Application**:
   You can now access the app at `https://script.google.com/a/macros/nyu.edu/s/${deploymentId}/exec`.
